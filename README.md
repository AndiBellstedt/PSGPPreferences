# PSGPPreferences - a native PowerShell way to manage Group Policy Preferences (formerly PolicyMaker)

The goal of this rather ambitious project is to provide full Group Policy Preferences experience in a command-line interface. Currentlly, Microsoft gives us only cmdlets for the Registry section of GPP, which is clearly not enough.

(Yep, all publicly available official documentation for this functionality is retired)

The most important part of GPP for me is "Local Users and Groups", that's why I started with it.

This module is a very much work in progress â€” expect breaking changes ahead.
Your help is welcome and appreciated.

## Installation

`Install-Module PSGPPreferences`

## What does already work

* The "Local Users and Groups" section, partially - Groups only:
  * You can create new groups and members (`New-GPPGroup`, `New-GPPGroupMember`),
  * retrieve groups and their members (`Get-GPPGroup`, `Get-GPPGroupMember`),
  * remove existing groups (`Remove-GPPGroup`),
  * add/remove members to/from groups (`Add-GPPGroupMember`, `Remove-GPPGroupMember`),
  * set group and member properties (`Set-GPPGroup`, `Set-GPPGroupMember`).

## What does not work, yet

* Other GPP sections
* Filters
* User context. Only the Machine context is supported right now

  * I expect implementing this feature to be a breaking change.
* Ordering
* Cross-domain editing

  * Currently you can work with group policies from your workstation's domain only

## Roadmap

1. Add Users support (section "Local Users and Groups") and add some tests
1. More tests
1. Support for changing the following properties:
    * [bool]$removePolicy
    * [bool]$bypassErrors
1. Support for disabling whole sections
1. Devices (v.0.3)
1. User context (v.1.0)
1. Services (v.1.0)
1. Filters (v.1.1)
    * At least some
1. Files (v.1.2)
1. Folders
1. Ordering
1. Environment
1. Ini Files
1. Data Sources
1. Shortcuts
1. Network Shares
1. Everything else

## What will NOT be implemented in the foreseeable future

* Filters: MSI, Registry (They are too complicated)
* Sections: Registry (Windows already has built-in cmdlets for that)
